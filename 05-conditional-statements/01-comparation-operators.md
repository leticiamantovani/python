# Lesson 1: Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values. They evaluate to True or False depending on the values you compare. For example, if we want to check if two values are equal, we use the == operator.

```python
x, y = 3, 5
print(x == y)  # Output: False
```

**We can't use a single = sign for comparison because it is reserved for assignment.** The comparison operators are:

- == Equal to
- != Not equal to
- < Less than
- > Greater than
- <= Less than or equal to
- >= Greater than or equal to
