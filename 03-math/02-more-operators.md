# Lesson 2: More Operators

There are a few more operators in Python that are commonly used in arithmetic operations:

- **Floor Division //**: Divides the first operand by the second and rounds down the result to an integer.
- **Modulus %**: Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.
- **Exponentiation** **: Raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.


Here is an example of each:

```python
x, y = 7, 2

print(x // y) # Output: 3  (7 divided by 2 is 3.5, after rounding down we get 3)

print(x % y)  # Output: 1  (7 divided by 2 is 3, with a remainder of 1)

print(x ** y) # Output: 49 (7 raised to the power of 2 is 49, 7*7 = 49)
```
