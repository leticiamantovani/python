## Lesson 3: Execution Order

In programming, code is generally executed line-by-line, from top to bottom, and this holds true for Python code as well. This means that the order in which you write your code is important.

- For example, the following code:

print("First")
print("Second")
print("Third")
will output:

First
Second
Third

### Challenge
In the code editor, there are three print statements. Rearrange them so that the output is:

Fourth
Fifth
Sixth
