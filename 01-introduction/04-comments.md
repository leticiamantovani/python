## Lesson 4: comments

In programming we can annotate our code without affecting the output. This is done using comments.

- Comments are **ignored by the interpreter**. They are used to explain what the code is doing or add any sort of message, usually for humans. They are useful for other programmers who may read your code, or for yourself in the future if you forget what a certain piece of code does.

In Python, **comments are created using the # character.** Any text after the # character on a line is considered a comment.

# This is a comment
If we want to ignore a piece of code, we can also comment it out temporarily. This is useful for debugging or testing.

# print("This line of code is commented out")
The above code will not print anything to the console because the line is commented out.
