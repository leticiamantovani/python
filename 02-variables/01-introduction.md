## Variables

- Variables are containers for storing data values.

## Rules

There are some strict rules for naming variables, if you break any of these rules it will cause an error:

- Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Variable names can't start with a number.
- Variable names can't contain spaces.
- Variable names can't be the same as Python keywords like for, if, (we will learn more about these later).
