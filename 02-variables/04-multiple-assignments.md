# Lesson 4: Multiple Assignments

In Python, you can assign values to multiple variables in a single line. This is called multiple assignment. Here's an example:

```python
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
```

In this example, the variable `x` is assigned the value `1`, `y` is assigned the value `2`, and `z` is assigned the value `3`. This can make your code more concise and easier to read.

You can also use multiple assignment to swap the values of two variables:

```python
a = 5
b = 10
a, b = b, a
```

In this example, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped without using a temporary variable.
